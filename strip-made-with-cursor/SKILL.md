# Setup Strip Made With Cursor

Sets up a `preToolUse` hook that intercepts tool calls and silently strips "Made with Cursor" (and its markdown-link variant) from any string values before Cursor writes them.

## What Gets Stripped

- `Made with Cursor` (case-insensitive, plain text)
- `Made with [Cursor](...)` (case-insensitive, markdown link variant)

When jq is available, the text is silently removed and the tool call proceeds. When jq is missing, the tool call is denied with a message asking the user to install jq.

## Steps

### 1. Ask scope

Ask the user: install for **this project only** (`.cursor/hooks.json`) or **globally** (`~/.cursor/hooks.json`)?

### 2. Copy the hook script

The bundled script is at: [scripts/strip-made-with-cursor.sh](scripts/strip-made-with-cursor.sh)

Copy it to the target location based on scope:

- **Project**: `.cursor/hooks/strip-made-with-cursor.sh`
- **Global**: `~/.cursor/hooks/strip-made-with-cursor.sh`

Make it executable with `chmod +x`.

### 3. Add hook to hooks.json

Add to the appropriate `hooks.json` file:

**Project** (`.cursor/hooks.json`):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      {
        "command": "bash .cursor/hooks/strip-made-with-cursor.sh"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Global** (`~/.cursor/hooks.json`):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      {
        "command": "bash ~/.cursor/hooks/strip-made-with-cursor.sh"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If the `hooks.json` file already exists, merge the hook entry into the existing `hooks.preToolUse` array — don't overwrite other hooks.

### 4. Verify

Run a quick test:

```bash
echo '{"tool_name":"edit_file","tool_input":{"content":"Made with Cursor"}}' | bash <path-to-script>
```

Should return JSON with `"decision":"allow"` and the branding text removed from `updated_input`.
